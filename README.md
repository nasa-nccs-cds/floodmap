# floodmap
This project computes surface water extents from lake shapefile boundary maps.  It uses the NRT Global Flood Mapping products produced from the LANCE-MODIS data processing system at NASA Goddard to compute the probability of water in each spatial cell within each shapefile boundary map.   It then thresholds this probability to produce water mask files.
